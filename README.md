# PeptideTrainer

Initial scripts for processing data for input to a neural network which can predict the m/z ion intensities 
on a mass spec output based on various data of the input peptide sequence.

These scripts are a part of a broader research project into the potential for incorporating neural networks 
into the peptide filtering stage of the MersSplicer software.
